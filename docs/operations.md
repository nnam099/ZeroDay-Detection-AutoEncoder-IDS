# Operations Guide

This project is suitable for research demonstrations and SOC triage prototypes. It is not a hardened production IDS.

## Pre-Demo Checklist

Run these commands before a demo:

```powershell
.\scripts\quality_check.ps1
```

Expected minimum state:

- readiness status is `READY` or `WARN` with only expected v15 artifact warnings
- v14 model and pipeline are present
- smoke checks pass
- artifact manifest verifies cleanly

## Dashboard Use

Start v14 dashboard:

```powershell
$env:IDS_MODEL_VERSION="v14"
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

Or use the PowerShell launcher:

```powershell
.\scripts\run_dashboard.ps1
```

Docker option:

```powershell
docker build -t zeroday-ids .
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env -v ${PWD}/checkpoints:/app/checkpoints -v ${PWD}/data:/app/data zeroday-ids
```

Upload CSV files with flow-like fields when possible:

- source/destination IP
- source/destination port
- protocol/service/state
- duration or timestamps
- directional bytes and packets

The dashboard rejects empty, oversized or malformed CSVs and warns when feature coverage is low.

## Artifact Handling

Checkpoint and pipeline files are local runtime artifacts and are not committed. After training or replacing artifacts, regenerate the manifest:

```powershell
python scripts/artifact_manifest.py
```

Before a demo, verify the manifest:

```powershell
python scripts/artifact_manifest.py --verify
```

## LLM Handling

LLM triage is optional. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill only the provider key you intend to use. Never commit `.env`.

If no provider key is configured, the dashboard still runs and returns deterministic fallback triage text.

## Production Gaps

Before production use, add:

- authentication and authorization for the dashboard
- signed/trusted artifact storage
- monitored deployment and audit logging
- calibrated metrics from the current training code
- real-time ingestion integration
- analyst feedback loop and false-positive review process
