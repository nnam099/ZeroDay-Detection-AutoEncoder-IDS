# Zero-Day Detection AutoEncoder IDS

Prototype IDS for UNSW-NB15 research and SOC-style demonstrations. The project combines known-attack classification, reconstruction-error based zero-day/OOD detection, Streamlit dashboard analysis, FastAPI inference serving, SHAP explainability, heuristic MITRE ATT&CK mapping and optional LLM triage.

> This is a research/demo project, not a production IDS. Analyst review and supporting SIEM/firewall/endpoint evidence are still required.

## Overview

The training pipeline learns from selected known attack classes and holds out other classes to simulate zero-day or out-of-distribution traffic. The dashboard and FastAPI server load saved artifacts and support single-alert analysis, CSV batch uploads and real-time JSON prediction.

Main flow:

1. Load and clean UNSW-NB15 CSV files.
2. Engineer flow features and encode categorical fields.
3. Train a hybrid supervised classifier + contrastive representation + autoencoder model.
4. Calibrate anomaly/zero-day thresholds.
5. Save checkpoint and preprocessing pipeline artifacts.
6. Analyze alerts in the Streamlit dashboard or call the FastAPI `/predict` endpoint.
7. Attach SHAP, MITRE, uncertainty and optional LLM context for SOC triage.

## Current Status

- v14 is the operational default because local artifacts exist in `checkpoints/`.
- Runtime dependencies are pinned in `requirements.txt`; smoke-check dependency ranges are in `requirements-smoke.txt`; developer tooling is in `requirements-dev.txt`.
- `scripts/smoke_check.py` passes locally with 54 tests, with the v15 artifact smoke test skipped until v15 artifacts exist.
- Smoke coverage includes artifact contract validation, threshold metadata validation, artifact manifest hashing, duplicate feature-name rejection, environment readiness checks, export config handling, checkpoint metadata patch logic, SQLite alert store persistence, CSV input guardrails, CSV normalization quality checks, dashboard preprocessing/context contracts, dashboard UI helper contracts, AI context selection, alert queue filtering, top-N batch alert selection, alert entity enrichment, lightweight correlation, time-window incident grouping, labeled evaluation reporting, API edge cases, Recon/DoS prototype separation, LLM fallback behavior, MITRE mapping and v14 artifact loading.
- `llm_agent.py` lazy-loads provider clients, so importing dashboard code does not require an API key.
- A Windows GitHub Actions smoke workflow is available at `.github/workflows/smoke.yml`.
- A Dockerfile is available for FastAPI inference on port `8080`.
- v14 artifact evaluation has been regenerated from the current saved artifacts on `UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv`; `results/ids_v14_results.json` includes accuracy, per-class recall, OOD detection rate, false-positive rate and threshold profile. Current normal false-positive rate is high, so threshold calibration remains a priority before operational use.

## Features

- Known-attack classification for classes such as `Normal`, `DoS`, `Exploits`, `Reconnaissance` and `Generic`.
- Zero-day/OOD detection using reconstruction error, optional adaptive AE thresholding, classifier confidence and a learned logistic-regression hybrid score.
- Streamlit SOC dashboard for single alert review, CSV batch analysis, alert history and AI follow-up.
- FastAPI inference server for real-time JSON predictions from saved v14 artifacts.
- Monte Carlo Dropout uncertainty for served predictions, with `LOW_CONFIDENCE` labeling when entropy is high.
- SQLite alert store for persisted queue history, status, analyst notes, queue filtering, top-N batch alert persistence and lightweight correlation groups.
- Time-window incident grouping across repeated source IP, service, class and attack-family signals in the analyst queue.
- Real-world CSV normalization for common firewall/flow/Zeek/Suricata-like exports.
- CSV upload guardrails for empty, oversized or malformed files.
- SHAP top-feature explanation.
- Heuristic MITRE ATT&CK mapping.
- Optional LLM triage through Groq, Gemini, OpenAI or Anthropic.

## Setup

Recommended:

- Python 3.11 for pinned runtime work. Python 3.11 is used by CI.
- Windows PowerShell or a Unix-like shell.

Clone the correct repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/nnam099/ZeroDay-Detection-AutoEncoder-IDS.git
cd ZeroDay-Detection-AutoEncoder-IDS
```

Create/activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
.\scripts\install_requirements.ps1
```

Manual install:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONUTF8="1"
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"
python -m pip install --progress-bar off -r requirements.txt
```

Minimal dependencies for smoke checks only:

```powershell
python -m pip install --progress-bar off -r requirements-smoke.txt
```

Developer test dependencies:

```powershell
python -m pip install --progress-bar off -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Dependency policy:

- `requirements.txt` is the lock-style runtime set for dashboard/API/demo execution.
- `requirements-smoke.txt` keeps broad lower bounds so CI can run compile, lint and unit smoke checks without installing optional dashboard/LLM extras.
- `requirements-dev.txt` contains local developer tools such as `ruff`, `pytest` and `pre-commit`.

The UTF-8 environment variables avoid console encoding failures when the project path contains Vietnamese characters.

Optional LLM setup:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# then fill the provider key you actually use
```

## Data

Place UNSW-NB15 CSV files in `data/`, for example:

```text
data/
  UNSW-NB15_1.csv
  UNSW-NB15_2.csv
  UNSW-NB15_3.csv
  UNSW-NB15_4.csv
  UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv
  UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv
```

`data/` is ignored by git because it is large and local.

## Reproducibility

- Runtime packages are pinned in `requirements.txt`; test-only packages are pinned in `requirements-dev.txt`.
- v14 training defaults to seed `42`. Override it with `--seed` when running `train.py` or `src/ids_v14_unswnb15.py`.
- Data splits, PyTorch, NumPy, Python hashing and DataLoader workers are seeded through `seed_everything()` and seeded worker initialization.
- Local artifacts are intentionally not committed: `checkpoints/*.pth`, `checkpoints/*.pkl`, CSV datasets and SQLite files can be large or environment-specific.
- Use `scripts/artifact_manifest.py` after training to record local artifact hashes.

Pretrained artifacts are not currently published in this repository. For demos, train/export artifacts locally or attach a trusted release asset, Hugging Face artifact, Google Drive file or internal model registry object, then point runtime tools at it with `IDS_MODEL_PATH` and `IDS_PIPELINE_PATH`.

## Run Dashboard

Default dashboard mode uses v14:

```powershell
$env:IDS_MODEL_VERSION="v14"
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

PowerShell launcher:

```powershell
.\scripts\run_dashboard.ps1
```

Important environment variables:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `IDS_MODEL_VERSION` | `v14` or `v15` |
| `IDS_MODEL_PATH` | Path to model `.pth` |
| `IDS_PIPELINE_PATH` | Path to pipeline `.pkl` |
| `IDS_DATA_DIR` | Dataset directory |
| `IDS_SAMPLE_DATA_PATH` | Sample CSV path for dashboard |
| `IDS_ALERT_DB_PATH` | SQLite alert history path, default `results/alerts.sqlite3` |
| `IDS_DASHBOARD_MAX_CSV_BYTES` | Max uploaded CSV size for dashboard parsing, default `52428800` |
| `IDS_DASHBOARD_MAX_CSV_ROWS` | Max uploaded CSV rows for dashboard batch inference, default `100000` |
| `IDS_DASHBOARD_PREVIEW_MAX_ROWS` | Max raw CSV preview rows, default `1000` |
| `IDS_DASHBOARD_SESSION_RAW_MAX_ROWS` | Max raw CSV rows retained in Streamlit session state, default `100000` |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `none`, `groq`, `gemini`, `openai` or `anthropic` |

If model or pipeline artifacts are missing, the dashboard falls back to demo mode. Alert history is persisted locally in SQLite; database files are ignored by git.

## Run Inference API

The FastAPI server is inference-only. It loads the saved v14 checkpoint and preprocessing pipeline at startup from environment variables:

```powershell
$env:IDS_MODEL_PATH="checkpoints/ids_v14_model.pth"
$env:IDS_PIPELINE_PATH="checkpoints/ids_v14_pipeline.pkl"
uvicorn src.serve:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

Prediction request. Replace `61` with the feature count in your checkpoint if you retrain with a different feature set:

```powershell
$body = @{ features = @(0..60 | ForEach-Object { 0.0 }) } | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/predict" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body
```

The `features` array must match the checkpoint feature count. The server applies the saved `RobustScaler` from `ids_v14_pipeline.pkl`, then returns:

```json
{
  "label": "Normal",
  "confidence": 0.99,
  "ae_re": 0.01,
  "hybrid_score": 0.02,
  "is_anomaly": false,
  "uncertainty": {
    "entropy": 0.1,
    "std_max_class": 0.01
  }
}
```

Uncertainty is estimated with Monte Carlo Dropout over 30 stochastic forward passes. If `uncertainty.entropy > 1.5`, the API response uses `"label": "LOW_CONFIDENCE"` so clients can route the alert for analyst review.

For production-style integrations, use `/predict/flow` with a single firewall, NetFlow, Zeek or Suricata-like event. The API maps common field names into the saved feature contract before scoring:

```powershell
$event = @{
  event = @{
    src_ip = "10.0.0.5"
    dst_ip = "172.16.1.10"
    src_port = 52512
    dst_port = 443
    protocol = "tcp"
    service = "https"
    duration = 1.25
    bytes = 2048
    packets = 12
  }
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3 -Compress
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/predict/flow" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body $event
```

The response includes the IDS verdict plus normalization quality so downstream SOC tooling can decide whether to auto-ticket or send the event to manual review:

```json
{
  "label": "Zero-Day Candidate",
  "classifier_class": "Normal",
  "confidence": 0.42,
  "ae_re": 0.73,
  "hybrid_score": 0.86,
  "is_anomaly": true,
  "zero_day_rule": "vote_2_of_3",
  "risk": 88,
  "normalization": {
    "schema": "firewall_or_flow_csv",
    "quality": "MEDIUM",
    "feature_coverage": 0.72,
    "mapped_columns": {
      "srcip": "src_ip",
      "dstip": "dst_ip"
    },
    "warnings": [
      "Feature coverage is moderate; treat scores as triage signals."
    ]
  }
}
```

Docker:

```bash
docker build -t ids-v14-serve .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -v "$(pwd)/checkpoints:/app/checkpoints:ro" \
  -e IDS_MODEL_PATH=/app/checkpoints/ids_v14_model.pth \
  -e IDS_PIPELINE_PATH=/app/checkpoints/ids_v14_pipeline.pkl \
  ids-v14-serve
```

Local checkpoint files are ignored by git and excluded by `.dockerignore`, so mount artifacts into the container or copy them into a deployment-specific image.

## Train

Train v14:

```bash
python train.py --data_dir data/ --save_dir checkpoints/ --plot_dir plots/
```

The default v14 training config now gives extra sampler/loss weight to the weak
known classes observed in artifact evaluation (`Exploits` and
`Reconnaissance`) while reducing the previous DoS sampler bias. Override these
without code changes:

```bash
python train.py --class_loss_weights "Exploits=3.0,Reconnaissance=3.0" \
  --class_sampler_weights "Exploits=4.0,Reconnaissance=4.0" \
  --dos_sampler_weight 1.5
```

PowerShell launcher:

```powershell
.\scripts\train_v14.ps1
```

Quick export helper for dashboard artifacts:

```bash
python export_model.py --data_dir data --epochs 5 --patience 3
```

Train v15:

```bash
python src/ids_v15_unswnb15.py --config configs/config_default.yaml
```

PowerShell launcher:

```powershell
.\scripts\train_v15.ps1
```

Training outputs:

- model weights `.pth`
- pipeline `.pkl`
- plots in `plots/`
- metric summary in `results/`

### Kaggle Retraining

On Kaggle, upload this repository as a working notebook dataset or clone it into
`/kaggle/working`, then attach UNSW-NB15/CICIDS datasets as Kaggle inputs. Copy
or symlink the CSV files into one training directory before running:

```bash
cd /kaggle/working/ZeroDay-Detection-AutoEncoder-IDS
python train.py \
  --data_dir /kaggle/working/data \
  --save_dir /kaggle/working/checkpoints \
  --plot_dir /kaggle/working/plots \
  --target_fpr 0.01
```

After training, download the generated `.pth`, `.pkl`, plots and result JSONs,
then point the dashboard at those artifacts with `IDS_MODEL_PATH` and
`IDS_PIPELINE_PATH`.

## Verify

Check local environment and artifact availability:

```powershell
python scripts/check_environment.py
```

Create or verify local artifact hashes:

```powershell
python scripts/artifact_manifest.py
python scripts/artifact_manifest.py --verify
```

Run the full smoke check:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONUTF8="1"
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"
python scripts/smoke_check.py
```

Run lint only:

```powershell
python -m ruff check .
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| `IDS_MODEL_PATH must be set` | Set `IDS_MODEL_PATH` and `IDS_PIPELINE_PATH` before starting `uvicorn src.serve:app`. |
| `expected N features, received M` | Send exactly the feature count saved in the checkpoint/pipeline; current local v14 artifacts use 61 features. |
| Dashboard starts in demo mode | Confirm `checkpoints/ids_v14_model.pth` and `checkpoints/ids_v14_pipeline.pkl` exist or set explicit artifact paths. |
| Too many zero-day candidates on a new CSV | Run `scripts/evaluate_csv.py --calibrate-thresholds` on labeled benign rows and load the generated threshold profile. |
| Import or console encoding errors on Windows paths | Set `PYTHONUTF8=1` and `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`; `scripts/smoke_check.py` already does this for subprocesses. |
| Docker container cannot find artifacts | Mount `checkpoints/` into `/app/checkpoints` or build a deployment-specific image that includes trusted artifacts. |

## Regenerate v14 Evaluation Report

Evaluate the current saved v14 artifacts without retraining:

```powershell
python scripts/regenerate_v14_report.py --csv-path data\UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv --label-col attack_cat
```

This refreshes `results/ids_v14_results.json` and writes evaluation plots in `plots/`:

- `v14_eval_verdict_distribution.png`
- `v14_eval_score_distribution.png`
- `v14_eval_known_class_recall.png`

The report includes detection accuracy, known-class recall, OOD detection rate, normal false-positive rate and the active threshold profile. A high false-positive rate means the current thresholds need recalibration before using the model for operational alerting.
If `checkpoints/local_thresholds.json` exists, the report also includes a calibrated-threshold what-if section. With `target_fpr=0.05` on the current test CSV, the local vote profile reduces normal FPR to about `4.70%`, but OOD detection drops to about `5.54%`, so this is a precision/recall tradeoff rather than a free improvement.

## Evaluate and Calibrate CSV Drift

Use the CSV evaluator before retraining when a new dataset produces too many
OOD/zero-day candidate hypotheses. It runs the saved model/pipeline outside Streamlit, writes a
score distribution report and can calibrate a local threshold profile.

```powershell
python scripts/evaluate_csv.py "path\to\Tuesday-WorkingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv" --scores-csv
```

If the CSV has a benign/attack label column, calibrate thresholds from benign
rows at the requested false-positive rate:

```powershell
python scripts/evaluate_csv.py "path\to\Tuesday-WorkingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv" `
  --label-col Label `
  --calibrate-thresholds `
  --target-fpr 0.01 `
  --threshold-output checkpoints\local_thresholds.json
```

The dashboard automatically loads `checkpoints/local_thresholds.json` when it is
present. Override with `IDS_THRESHOLD_PROFILE` if you want to test another
profile. Local profiles use vote-based OOD candidate decisions by default, so a row
must cross multiple calibrated signals instead of only the hybrid score.

Current local calibration example:

```powershell
python scripts/evaluate_csv.py data\UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv --label-col attack_cat --calibrate-thresholds --target-fpr 0.05
python scripts/regenerate_v14_report.py --csv-path data\UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv --label-col attack_cat
```

The dashboard loads `checkpoints/local_thresholds.json` automatically. Keep this file local unless you intentionally publish a calibrated deployment profile.

## Prepare Production Flow Data

For a more realistic deployment workflow, collect traffic with CICFlowMeter and
export CSV files with columns such as `Flow ID`, `Source IP`, `Destination IP`,
`Source Port`, `Destination Port`, `Protocol`, `Timestamp`, `Flow Duration`,
packet counters, byte counters and `Label`.

Normalize those files into the fixed production schema and split them
chronologically:

```powershell
python scripts/prepare_production_flow_data.py data\Monday-WorkingHours.csv `
  data\Tuesday-WorkingHours.csv `
  --source cicflowmeter `
  --output-dir results\production_flow_data
```

The output directory contains:

- `production_flows.csv`: all normalized rows with stable operational columns.
- `train.csv`, `validation.csv`, `test.csv`: time-ordered splits.
- `manifest.json`: schema columns, source reports, time range and label counts.

The production schema includes analyst workflow labels:

- `normal`
- `known_attack`
- `suspicious`
- `false_positive`
- `unknown`

Dataset labels such as `BENIGN`, `DoS Hulk` or `PortScan` are mapped to initial
`analyst_label` values. To label only reviewed rows, provide an override CSV:

```csv
flow_id,analyst_label,attack_category
10.0.0.8-172.16.1.20-44444-80-6,suspicious,Needs review
```

Then run:

```powershell
python scripts/prepare_production_flow_data.py data\Monday-WorkingHours.csv `
  --label-overrides labels\reviewed_flows.csv `
  --label-key flow_id `
  --output-dir results\production_flow_data
```

Committed samples for parser and smoke tests are in `data/samples/`.

Run the full local quality gate:

```powershell
.\scripts\quality_check.ps1
```

Or run commands separately:

```bash
python -m ruff check .
python -m compileall src dashboard scripts export_model.py patch_checkpoint.py tests
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

For demo and runtime procedures, see [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md).

## Limitations

- MITRE mapping is heuristic and should be treated as triage support.
- `Zero-Day Candidate` means the row crossed OOD/anomaly rules and needs analyst review. It is not proof of a novel attack, attribution or compromise.
- Zero-day results depend strongly on feature quality, scaler compatibility and threshold calibration. The regenerated v14 artifact report currently shows a high normal false-positive rate, so recalibrate thresholds before operational demos that claim realistic SOC precision.
- Real-world CSV normalization is approximate when directional counters or timing fields are missing.
- LLM triage is optional decision support and must not be treated as the detection engine or a final verdict.
- v15 is experimental until v15 artifacts are trained/exported and smoke-tested.
- The dashboard is not hardened for production deployment: no authentication, no realtime packet capture and no deployment security controls.
